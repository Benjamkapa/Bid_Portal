# TypeScript Guide

## What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It allows developers to catch errors early through a type system and to make JavaScript development more efficient.

## Key Features of TypeScript
1. **Static Typing**: TypeScript allows you to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values, which helps catch errors at compile time.
2. **Interfaces**: You can define interfaces to describe the shape of objects, making it easier to work with complex data structures.
3. **Type Inference**: TypeScript can automatically infer types based on the assigned values, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.
4. **Generics**: TypeScript supports generics, allowing you to create reusable components and functions that work with any data type.
5. **Modules**: TypeScript supports ES6 modules, enabling better organization of code and easier imports/exports.

## Basic Types
- **Number**: Represents numeric values.
- **String**: Represents text values.
- **Boolean**: Represents true/false values.
- **Array**: Represents a collection of values of a specific type.
- **Tuple**: Represents an array with fixed number of elements of different types.
- **Enum**: A way to define a set of named constants.
- **Any**: A type that can hold any value, bypassing type checking.

## Example of TypeScript Code
```typescript
// Defining a variable with a specific type
let age: number = 25;

// Defining a function with typed parameters and return type
function greet(name: string): string {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Using an interface
interface User {
    id: number;
    name: string;
}

const user: User = {
    id: 1,
    name: "John Doe"
};
```

## TypeScript with React
TypeScript can be used with React to provide type safety for components and props. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```typescript
import React from 'react';

interface Props {
    title: string;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({ title }) => {
    return <h1>{title}</h1>;
};

export default MyComponent;
```

## Conclusion
TypeScript enhances JavaScript development by providing a robust type system, making code more predictable and easier to maintain. It is especially useful in large applications where type safety can prevent many common errors.
